"""
Firstly i would like to explain this method stuffs.
In Python lists we have some methods (append,pop,remove...)
these methods is providing to make some process more simple.
for example:
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,"Python"]
if you want to add something to in this list.There is a simple method in python as
list1.append("Learning Programming")
now if we check our list1;
[1,2,3,4,5,6,"Python","Learning Programming"]
"""

Now I will coding some simple methods,LEts start
